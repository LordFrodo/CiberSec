Another web server enumeration tool we should talk about is Nikto. Nikto is an open-source web vulnerability scanner that has been around for many years. Itâ€™s not as robust as the commercial web vulnerability scanners; however, it is very handy for running a quick script to enumerate information about a web server and the applications it is hosting. Because of the speed at which Nikto works to scan a web server, it is very noisy. It provides a number of options for scanning, including the capability to authenticate to a web application that requires a username and password. Example 3-33 shows the output of a Nikto scan being run against the same host as in Example 3-32 (192.168.88.251). The output in Example 3-33 shows similar results to the Nmap script used in Example 3-32.

Example: nikto -h 10.10.82.0
