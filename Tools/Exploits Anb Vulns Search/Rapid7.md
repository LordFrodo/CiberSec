Much like other services such as Exploit DB and NVD, Rapid7 is a vulnerability research database. The only difference being that this database also acts as an exploit database. Using this service, you can filter by type of vulnerability (I.e. application and operating system).

Additionally, the database contains instructions for exploiting applications using the popular Metasploit tool (you will learn about this tool in-depth later in the learning path). For example, this entry on [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/) is for “[Wordpress Plugin SP Project & Document](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/wp_plugin_sp_project_document_rce/)”, where we can see instructions on how to use an exploit module to abuse this vulnerability.
