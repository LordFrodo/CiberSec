To perform an XXE injection attack that retrieves an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem, you need to modify the submitted XML in two ways:

- Introduce (or edit) a `DOCTYPE` element that defines an external entity containing the path to the file.
- Edit a data value in the XML that is returned in the application's response, to make use of the defined external entity.

For example, suppose a shopping application checks for the stock level of a product by submitting the following XML to the server:

`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <stockCheck><productId>381</productId></stockCheck>`

The application performs no particular defenses against XXE attacks, so you can exploit the XXE vulnerability to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file by submitting the following XXE payload:

`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]> <stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId></stockCheck>`

This XXE payload defines an external entity `&xxe;` whose value is the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file and uses the entity within the `productId` value.

## Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks

Aside from retrieval of sensitive data, the other main impact of XXE attacks is that they can be used to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF). This is a potentially serious vulnerability in which the server-side application can be induced to make HTTP requests to any URL that the server can access.

To exploit an XXE vulnerability to perform an SSRF attack, you need to define an external XML entity using the URL that you want to target, and use the defined entity within a data value. If you can use the defined entity within a data value that is returned in the application's response, then you will be able to view the response from the URL within the application's response, and so gain two-way interaction with the back-end system. If not, then you will only be able to perform blind SSRF attacks (which can still have critical consequences).

In the following XXE example, the external entity will cause the server to make a back-end HTTP request to an internal system within the organization's infrastructure:

`<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://internal.vulnerable-website.com/"> ]>`
