A **cryptographic failure** refers to any vulnerability arising from the misuse (or lack of use) of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information. Web applications require cryptography to provide confidentiality for their users at many levels.

Take, for example, a secure email application:

- When you are accessing your email account using your browser, you want to be sure that the communications between you and the server are encrypted. That way, any eavesdropper trying to capture your network packets won't be able to recover the content of your email addresses. When we encrypt the network traffic between the client and server, we usually refer to this as **encrypting data in transit**.  
    
- Since your emails are stored in some server managed by your provider, it is also desirable that the email provider can't read their client's emails. To this end, your emails might also be encrypted when stored on the servers. This is referred to as **encrypting data at rest**.

Cryptographic failures often end up in web apps accidentally divulging sensitive data. This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates of birth, financial information), but it could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords.

At more complex levels, taking advantage of some cryptographic failures often involves techniques such as "Man in The Middle Attacks", whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device they control. Then, they would take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to access the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted in the first place). Of course, many examples are much simpler, and vulnerabilities can be found in web apps that can be exploited without advanced networking knowledge. Indeed, in some cases, the sensitive data can be found directly on the web server itself.  

The web application in this box contains one such vulnerability. To continue, read through the supporting material in the following tasks.

The most common way to store a large amount of data in a format easily accessible from many locations is in a database. This is perfect for something like a web application, as many users may interact with the website at any time. Database engines usually follow the Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax.  

In a production environment, it is common to see databases set up on dedicated servers running a database service such as MySQL or MariaDB; however, databases can also be stored as files. These are referred to as "flat-file" databases, as they are stored as a single file on the computer. This is much easier than setting up an entire database server and could potentially be seen in smaller web applications. Accessing a database server is outwith the scope of today's task, so let's focus instead on flat-file databases.

As mentioned previously, flat-file databases are stored as a file on the disk of a computer. Usually, this would not be a problem for a web app, but what happens if the database is stored underneath the root directory of the website (i.e. one of the files accessible to the user connecting to the website)? Well, we can download and query it on our own machine, with full access to everything in the database. Sensitive Data Exposure, indeed!

That is a big hint for the challenge, so let's briefly cover some of the syntax we would use to query a flat-file database.

The most common (and simplest) format of a flat-file database is an SQLite database. These can be interacted with in most programming languages and have a dedicated client for querying them on the command line. This client is called `sqlite3` and is installed on many Linux distributions by default.  

Let's suppose we have successfully managed to download a database:

Linux

```shell-session
user@linux$ ls -l 
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 8192 Feb  2 20:33 example.db
                                                                                                                                                              
user@linux$ file example.db 
example.db: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3039002, file counter 1, database pages 2, cookie 0x1, schema 4, UTF-8, version-valid-for 1
```

We can see that there is an SQLite database in the current folder.

To access it, we use `sqlite3 <database-name>`:

Linux

```shell-session
user@linux$ sqlite3 example.db                     
SQLite version 3.39.2 2022-07-21 15:24:47
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> 
```

From here, we can see the tables in the database by using the `.tables` command:

Linux

```shell-session
user@linux$ sqlite3 example.db                     
SQLite version 3.39.2 2022-07-21 15:24:47
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables
customers
```

At this point, we can dump all the data from the table, but we won't necessarily know what each column means unless we look at the table information. First, let's use `PRAGMA table_info(customers);` to see the table information. Then we'll use `SELECT * FROM customers;` to dump the information from the table:

Linux

```shell-session
sqlite> PRAGMA table_info(customers);
0|cudtID|INT|1||1
1|custName|TEXT|1||0
2|creditCard|TEXT|0||0
3|password|TEXT|1||0

sqlite> SELECT * FROM customers;
0|Joy Paulson|4916 9012 2231 7905|5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
1|John Walters|4671 5376 3366 8125|fef08f333cc53594c8097eba1f35726a
2|Lena Abdul|4353 4722 6349 6685|b55ab2470f160c331a99b8d8a1946b19
3|Andrew Miller|4059 8824 0198 5596|bc7b657bd56e4386e3397ca86e378f70
4|Keith Wayman|4972 1604 3381 8885|12e7a36c0710571b3d827992f4cfe679
5|Annett Scholz|5400 1617 6508 1166|e2795fc96af3f4d6288906a90a52a47f
```

We can see from the table information that there are four columns: `custID`, `custName`, `creditCard` and `password`. You may notice that this matches up with the results. Take the first row:

`0|Joy Paulson|4916 9012 2231 7905|5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99   `   

We have the custID (0), the custName (Joy Paulson), the creditCard (4916 9012 2231 7905) and a password hash (5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99).

In the next task, we'll look at cracking this hash.
