Structured Query Language Injection.
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a feature-rich language used for querying databases, these SQL queries are better referred to as statements.  

  

The simplest of the commands which we'll cover in this task is used to retrieve (select), update, insert and delete data. Although somewhat similar, some databases servers have their own syntax and slight changes to how things work. All of these examples are based on a MySQL database. After learning the lessons, you'll easily be able to search for alternative syntax online for the different servers. It's worth noting that SQL syntax is not case sensitive. Some statements are:

- [[Select]]
- [[Union]]
- [[Insert]]
- [[Update]]
- [[Delete]]
- [[Group_concat]]
- [[Information_schema]]
-
