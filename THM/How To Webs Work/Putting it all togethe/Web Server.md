A web server is a software that listens for incoming connections and then utilises the [[HTTP]] protocol to deliver web content to its clients. The most common web server software you'll come across is Apache, Nginx, IIS and NodeJS. A Web server delivers files from what's called its root directory, which is defined in the software settings. For example, Nginx and Apache share the same default location of /var/www/html in Linux operating systems, and IIS uses C:\inetpub\wwwroot for the Windows operating systems. So, for example, if you requested the fileÂ [http://www.example.com/picture.jpg](http://www.example.com/picture.jpg), it would send the file /var/www/html/picture.jpg from its local hard drive.
