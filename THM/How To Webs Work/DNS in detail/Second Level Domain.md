Taking tryhackme.com as an example, the .com part is the [[TLD]], and tryhackme is the Second Level Domain. When registering a domain name, the second-level domain is limited to 63 characters + the [[TLD]] and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens (cannot start or end with hyphens or have consecutive hyphens).
