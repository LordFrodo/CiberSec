Top Level Domain.
A TLD is the most righthand part of a domain name. So, for example, the tryhackme.com TLD is **.com**. There are two types of TLD, **gTLD (Generic Top Level) **and **ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain). **Historically a gTLD was meant to tell the user the domain name's purpose; for example, a .com would be for commercial purposes, .org for an organisation, .edu for education and .gov for government. And a ccTLD was used for geographical purposes, for example, .ca for sites based in Canada, .co.uk for sites based in the United Kingdom and so on.
