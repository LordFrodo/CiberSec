A subdomain sits on the left-hand side of the [[Second Level Domain]]using a period to separate it; for example, in the name admin.tryhackme.com the admin part is the subdomain. A subdomain name has the same creation restrictions as a Second-Level Domain. You can use multiple subdomains split with periods to create longer names, such as jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com. But the length must be kept to **253** characters or less. There is no limit to the number of subdomains you can create for your domain name.
