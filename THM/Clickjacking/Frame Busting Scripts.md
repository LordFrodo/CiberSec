Clickjacking attacks are possible whenever websites can be framed. Therefore, preventative techniques are based upon restricting the framing capability for websites. A common client-side protection enacted through the web browser is to use frame busting or frame breaking scripts. These can be implemented via proprietary browser JavaScript add-ons or extensions such as NoScript. Scripts are often crafted so that they perform some or all of the following behaviors:

- check and enforce that the current application window is the main or top window,
- make all frames visible,
- prevent clicking on invisible frames,
- intercept and flag potential clickjacking attacks to the user.

Frame busting techniques are often browser and platform specific and because of the flexibility of HTML they can usually be circumvented by attackers. As frame busters are JavaScript then the browser's security settings may prevent their operation or indeed the browser might not even support JavaScript. An effective attacker workaround against frame busters is to use the HTML5 iframe `sandbox` attribute. When this is set with the `allow-forms` or `allow-scripts` values and the `allow-top-navigation` value is omitted then the frame buster script can be neutralized as the iframe cannot check whether or not it is the top window:

`<iframe id="victim_website" src="https://victim-website.com" sandbox="allow-forms"></iframe>`

Both the `allow-forms` and `allow-scripts` values permit the specified actions within the iframe but top-level navigation is disabled. This inhibits frame busting behaviors while allowing functionality within the targeted site.
