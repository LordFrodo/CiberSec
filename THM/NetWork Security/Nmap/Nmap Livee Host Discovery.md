As already mentioned, starting with this room, we will use Nmap to discover systems and services actively. Nmap was created by Gordon Lyon (Fyodor), a network security expert and open source programmer. It was released in 1997. Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is free, open-source software released under GPL license. Nmap is an industry-standard tool for mapping networks, identifying live hosts, and discovering running services. Nmapâ€™s scripting engine can further extend its functionality, from fingerprinting services to exploiting vulnerabilities. A Nmap scan usually goes through the steps shown in the figure below, although many are optional and depend on the command-line arguments you provide.
