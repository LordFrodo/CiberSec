The favicon is a small icon displayed in the browser's address bar or tab used for branding a website.

Sometimes when frameworks are used to build a website, a favicon that is part of the installation gets leftover, and if the website developer doesn't replace this with a custom one, this can give us a clue on what framework is in use. OWASP host a database of common framework icons that you can use to check against the targets favicon [https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database). Once we know the framework stack, we can use external resources to discover more about it (see next section).

  

**Practical Exercise:**

  

On the AttackBox, open firefox and enter the url [https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/favicon/](https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/favicon/) here you'll see a basic website with a note saying "Website coming soon...", if you look at your tabs you'll notice an icon that confirms this site is using a favicon.

  

Viewing the page source you'll see line six contains a link to the images/favicon.ico file.

If you run the following command on the AttackBox, it will download the favicon and get its md5 hash value which you can then lookup on the
