Unlike the robots.txt file, which restricts what search engine crawlers can look at, the sitemap.xml file gives a list of every file the website owner wishes to be listed on a search engine. These can sometimes contain areas of the website that are a bit more difficult to navigate to or even list some old webpages that the current site no longer uses but are still working behind the scenes.

  

Take a look at the sitemap.xml file on the Acme IT Support website to see if there's any new content we haven't yet discovered: [http://10.10.7.246/sitemap.xml](http://10.10.7.246/sitemap.xml)[](http://10.10.7.246/sitemap.xml)Â (open this in the FireFox browser on the AttackBox).
