- **LeakLooker:** _[https://github.com/woj-ciech/LeakLooker](https://github.com/woj-ciech/LeakLooker)_

- **PwnDB:** _[https://github.com/davidtavarez/pwndb](https://github.com/davidtavarez/pwndb)_

Tools like h8mail and WhatBreach take advantage of breached data repositories of websites such as haveibeenpwned.com and snusbase.com. Historically, websites such as weleakinfo.com (seized by the FBI) have been used by criminals to dump information from past security breaches.
