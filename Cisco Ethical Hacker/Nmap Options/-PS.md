We can send a packet with the SYN (Synchronize) flag set to a TCP port, 80 by default, and wait for a response. An open port should reply with a SYN/ACK (Acknowledge); a closed port would result in an RST (Reset). In this case, we only check whether we will get any response to infer whether the host is up. The specific state of the port is not significant here. The figure below is a reminder of how a TCP 3-way handshake usually works.

If you want Nmap to use TCP SYN ping, you can do so via the option `-PS` followed by the port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, `-PS21` will target port 21, while `-PS21-25` will target ports 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. Finally `-PS80,443,8080` will target the three ports 80, 443, and 8080.

Privileged users (root and sudoers) can send TCP SYN packets and donâ€™t need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake even if the port is open, as shown in the figure below. Unprivileged users have no choice but to complete the 3-way handshake if the port is open.
