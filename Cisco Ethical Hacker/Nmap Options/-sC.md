A script is a piece of code that does not need to be compiled. In other words, it remains in its original human-readable form and does not need to be converted to machine language. Many programs provide additional functionality via scripts; moreover, scripts make it possible to add custom functionality that did not exist via the built-in commands. Similarly, Nmap provides support for scripts using the Lua language. A part of Nmap, Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is a Lua interpreter that allows Nmap to execute Nmap scripts written in Lua language. However, we don’t need to learn Lua to make use of Nmap scripts.

Your Nmap default installation can easily contain close to 600 scripts. Take a look at your Nmap installation folder. On the AttackBox, check the files at `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`, and you will notice that there are hundreds of scripts conveniently named starting with the protocol they target. We listed all the scripts starting with the HTTP on the AttackBox in the console output below; we found around 130 scripts starting with http. With future updates, you can only expect the number of installed scripts to increase.

You can specify to use any or a group of these installed scripts; moreover, you can install other user’s scripts and use them for your scans. Let’s begin with the default scripts. You can choose to run the scripts in the default category using `--script=default` or simply adding `-sC`. In addition to [default](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/default.html), categories include auth, broadcast, brute, default, discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln. A brief description is shown in the following table.

| Script Category | Description                                                            |

| `brute`         | Performs brute-force password auditing against logins                  |
| `default`       | Default scripts, same as `-sC`                                         |

| `fuzzer`        | Launch fuzzing attacks                                                 |
| `intrusive`     | Intrusive scripts such as brute-force attacks and exploitation         |
| `malware`       | Scans for backdoors                                                    |
| `safe`          | Safe scripts that won’t crash the target                               |
| `version`       | Retrieve service versions                                              |
