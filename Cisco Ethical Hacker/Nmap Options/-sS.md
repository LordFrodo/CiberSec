Unprivileged users are limited to connect scan. However, the default scan mode is SYN scan, and it requires a privileged (root or sudoer) user to run it. SYN scan does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, it tears down the connection once it receives a response from the server. Because we didnâ€™t establish a TCP connection, this decreases the chances of the scan being logged. We can select this scan type by using the `-sS` option. The figure below shows how the TCP SYN scan works without completing the TCP 3-way handshake.
