A TCP connect scan actually makes use of the underlying operating system’s networking mechanism to establish a full TCP connection with the target device being scanned. Because it creates a full connection, it creates more traffic (and thus takes more time to run). This is the default scan type that is used if no scan type is specified with the **nmap** command. However, it should typically be used only when a SYN scan is not an option, such as when a user who is running the **nmap** command does not have raw packet privileges on the operating system because many of the Nmap scan types rely on writing raw packets. This section illustrates how a TCP connect scan works and provides an example of a scan from a Kali Linux system. Table 3-3 defines the TCP connect scan responses.
