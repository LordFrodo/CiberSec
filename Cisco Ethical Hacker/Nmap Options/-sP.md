The enumeration of hosts is one of the first tasks you need to perform in the information-gathering phase of a penetration test. **_Host enumeration_** is performed internally and externally. When performed externally, you typically want to limit the IP addresses you are scanning to just the ones that are part of the scope of the test. This reduces the chance of inadvertently scanning an IP address that you are not authorized to test. When performing an internal host enumeration, you typically scan the full subnet or subnets of IP addresses being used by the target. Host enumeration is usually performed using a tool such as Nmap or Masscan; however, vulnerability scanners also perform this task as part of their automated testing. Example 3-23, earlier in this module, shows a sample Nmap ping scan being used for host enumeration on the network 192.168.88.0/24. In earlier versions of Nmap, the Nmap ping scan option was **-sP**
