**_Service enumeration_** is the process of identifying the services running on a remote system, and it is a primary focus of what Nmap does as a port scanner. Earlier discussion in this module highlights the various scan types and how they can be used to bypass filters. When you are connected to a system that is on a directly connected network segment, you can run some additional scripts to enumerate further. A port scan takes the perspective of a credentialed remote user. The Nmap **smb-enum-processes** NSE script enumerates services on a Windows system, and it does so by using credentials of a user who has access to read the status of services that are running. This is a handy tool for remotely querying a Windows system to determine the exact list of services running. The syntax of the command is as follows:

**nmap --script smb-enum-processes.nse --script-args smbusername=**_<username>_**, smbpass=**_<password>_ **-p445** _<host>_
