The Nmap scanner provides six timing templates that can be specified with the **-T** option and the template number (0 through 5) or name. Nmap timing templates enable you to dictate how aggressive a scan will be, while leaving Nmap to pick the exact timing values. These are the timing options:

- **-T0 (Paranoid)** : Very slow, used for IDS evasion
- **-T1 (Sneaky)** : Quite slow, used for IDS evasion
- **-T2 (Polite)** : Slows down to consume less bandwidth, runs about 10 times slower than the default
- **-T3 (Normal)** : Default, a dynamic timing model based on target responsiveness
- **-T4 (Aggressive)** : Assumes a fast and reliable network and may overwhelm targets
- **-T5 (Insane)** : Very aggressive; will likely overwhelm targets or miss open ports
