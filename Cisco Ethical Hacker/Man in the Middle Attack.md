n an **_on-path attack_** (previously known as a man-in-the-middle [MITM] attack), an attacker places himself or herself in-line between two devices or individuals that are communicating in order to eavesdrop (that is, steal sensitive data) or manipulate the data being transferred (such as by performing data corruption or data modification). On-path attacks can happen at Layer 2 or Layer 3. Figure 5-5 illustrates an on-path attack.

**_ARP Spoofing and ARP Cache Poisoning**

**_ARP cache poisoning_** (also known as ARP spoofing) is an example of an attack that leads to an on-path attack scenario. An ARP spoofing attack can target hosts, switches, and routers connected to a Layer 2 network by poisoning the ARP caches of systems connected to the subnet and intercepting traffic intended for other hosts on the subnet. In Figure 5-5, the attacker spoofs Layer 2 MAC addresses to make the victim believe that the Layer 2 address of the attacker is the Layer 2 address of its default gateway (10.2.3.4). The packets that are supposed to go to the default gateway are forwarded by the switch to the Layer 2 address of the attacker on the same network. The attacker can forward the IP packets to the correct destination in order to allow the client to access the web server (10.2.66.77).

**_Media Access Control (MAC) spoofing_** is an attack in which a threat actor impersonates the MAC address of another device (typically an infrastructure device such as a router). The MAC address is typically a hard-coded address on a network interface controller. In virtual environments, the MAC address could be a virtual address (that is, not assigned to a physical adapter). An attacker could spoof the MAC address of physical or virtual systems to either circumvent access control measures or perform an on-path attack.
