In some cases, it is best to run an authenticated scan against a target to get a full picture of the attack surface. An **_authenticated scan_** requires you to provide the scanner with a set of credentials that have root-level access to the system. The scanner actually logs in to the target via SSH or some other mechanism. It then runs commands like **[[netstat]]** to gather information from inside the host. Many of the commands that the scanner runs require root-level access to be able to gather the correct information from the system.
