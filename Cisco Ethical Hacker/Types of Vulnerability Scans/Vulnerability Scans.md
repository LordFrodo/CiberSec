The type of vulnerability scan to use is usually driven by scan policy that is created in the automated vulnerability scanning tool. Each tool has many options available for scanning. You can often just choose to do a full scan that will operate all scanning options, although you might not be able to use every option (for instance, if you are scanning a production environment or a device that is prone to crashing when scanning occurs). In such situations, you must be careful to select only the scan options that are less likely to cause issues. Let'sÂ take a closer look at the following typical scan types:

- [[Unauthenticated Scans]]
- [[Authenticated Scans]]
- [[Discovery Scans]]
- [[Full Scans]]
- [[Stealth Scans]]
- [[Compliance Scans]]
