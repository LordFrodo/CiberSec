As mentioned previously, a **_full scan_** typically involves enabling every scanning option in the scan policy. The options vary based on the scanner, but most vulnerability scanners have their categories of options defined similarly. For instance, they are typically organized by operating system, device manufacturer, device type, protocol, compliance, and type of attack, and the rest of the options might fall into a miscellaneous category. Example 3-44 shows a sample list of the plugin categories from the Nessus vulnerability scanner. As you can see from this list, there are a lot of plugins available for the scanner to run. It should also be obvious, based on the names of the plugin categories, that there will never be a single device that all of these plugins apply to. For instance, plugins for a macOS device would not be applicable to a Windows device. That is why you normally need to customize your plugin selection to reflect the environment that you are scanning. Doing so will reduce unnecessary traffic and speed up your scanning process.
