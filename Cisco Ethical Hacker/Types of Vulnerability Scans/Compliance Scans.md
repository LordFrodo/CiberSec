**_Compliance scans_** are network and application tests (scans) typically driven by the market or governance that the environment serves and regulatory compliance. An example of this would be the information security environment for a healthcare entity, which must adhere to the requirements sent forth by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This is where a vulnerability scanner comes into play. It is possible to use a vulnerability scanner to address the specific requirements that a policy requires. Vulnerability scanners often have the capability to import a compliance policy file. This policy file can typically map to specific plugins/attacks that the scanner is able to perform. Once the policy is imported, the specific set of compliance checks can be run against a target system.

The challenge with compliance requirements is that there are many different types for different industries and government agencies, and they can all be interpreted in various ways. Some of the checks might be straightforward. If a requirement check is looking for a specific command to be run and that the output be a 1 instead of a 0, that is very simple for a vulnerability scanner to determine; however, many requirements leave more to be interpreted. This makes it very difficult for a tool like a vulnerability scanner to make a determination. Most vulnerability scanners also have the capability to create custom compliance policies. This is a valuable option for penetration testers, who typically want to fine-tune the scanner policy for each engagement.
