A **_discovery scan_** is primarily meant to identify the attack surface of a target. A port scan is a major part of what a discovery scan performs. A scanner may actually use a tool like [[Nmap]] to perform the port scan process. It then pulls the results of the port scan into its database to use that information for further discovery. For instance, the result of the port scan might come back showing that ports 80, 22, and 443 are open and listening. From there, the scanning tool probes those ports to identify exactly what service is running on each port. For example, say that it identifies that an Apache Tomcat 8.5.22 web server is running on ports 80 and 443. Knowing that a web server is running on the ports, the scanner can then perform further discovery tasks that are specific to web servers and applications. Now say that, at the same time, the scanner identifies that OpenSSH is listening on port 22. From there, the scanner can probe the SSH service to identify information about its configuration and capabilities, such as preferred and supported cryptographic algorithms. This type of information is useful for identifying vulnerabilities in later phases of testing.
