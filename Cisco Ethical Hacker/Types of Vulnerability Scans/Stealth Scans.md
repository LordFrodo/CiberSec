There are sometimes situations in which you must scan an environment that is in a production state. In such situations, there is typically a requirement for running a scan without alerting the defensive position of the environment; such a scan is called a **_stealth scan_**. In this case, you will want to implement a vulnerability scanner in a manner that makes the target less likely to detect the activity. Vulnerability scanners are pretty noisy; however, there are some options you can configure to make a scan quieter. For example, as discussed earlier in this module, there are different types of Nmap scans, and they can be detected by network intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) or host firewalls. You have learned that a SYN scan is a fairly stealthy type of scan to run. This same concept applies to vulnerability scanners because they all use some kind of port scanner to enumerate the target. These same options are available in the vulnerability scannerâ€™s configuration. You can also disable any plugins/attacks that might be especially likely to generate noisy traffic, such as any that perform denial-of-service attacks, which would definitely arouse some concerns on the target network.

Aside from the modifications to a traditional vulnerability scanner just described, there is also the concept of a passive vulnerability scanner. A _passive vulnerability scanner_ monitors and analyzes the network traffic. Based on the traffic it sees, it can determine what the topology of the network consists of and what service the hosts on the network are listening on. From the detailed information about the traffic at the packet layer, a passive vulnerability scanner can determine if any of those services or even clients have vulnerabilities. For instance, if a Windows client with an outdated version of Internet Explorer is connecting to an Apache web server that is also outdated, the scanner will identify the versions of the client and server from the monitored traffic. It can then compare those versions to its database of known vulnerabilities and report the findings based on only the passive monitoring it performed. Figure 3-16 illustrates how this type of scanner typically works.
