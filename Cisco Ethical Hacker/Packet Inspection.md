As a penetration tester, you can use tools like [[Wireshark]], [[tshark]], and [[tcpdump]] to collect packet captures for packet inspection and eavesdropping. Anyone who has been involved with networking or security has at some point used these tools to capture and analyze traffic on a network. For a penetration tester, such tools can be convenient for performing passive reconnaissance. Of course, this type of reconnaissance requires either a physical or a wireless connection to the target.
